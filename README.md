# UMPenTest_RFID_hack
Conducts MIM and DOS exploits on RFID cards of various bit capacities.
Tested using iclass r-640x-300 reader (tag).

## TODOs
MVP: 
- [ ] NILS: Ardunino sends 56 bits to Raspberry Pi.
- [x] Arduino reads 56 bits from a RFID card through a reader.
- [ ] Raspberry Pi runs Flask server, which stores 56 bit cardreads in cache.
- [ ] 

# LATER Extensions:
[ ] Read and write other bit lengths, such as 37 bits.
